<h2>Featured Projects</h2>

<div class="project-card">
  <img src="/assets/images/p1_house.jpg" alt="London House Price">
  <h3>1) London House Price Prediction</h3>
  <p>
The story begins with shelter: My first end-to-end ML project that estimates fair market prices for London properties using over 200k records (Kaggle).

<strong>ML:</strong> XGBoost Regressor (outperformed LightGBM & Random Forest).
<strong>Stack:</strong> Python, scikit-learn, pandas, Flask; deployed on Render.

<div class="project-card">
  <img src="/assets/images/p2_loan.jpg" alt="Loan Default">
  <h3>2) Loan Default Predictor</h3>
  <p>
While the first app was a regression problem, this one is a classification problem. Imagine using my first app to estimate the price of a house, and then approaching the bank for a loan. The bank could now use this app to decide whether you are likely to default on that loan or not.

The project uses the Kaggle “Give Me Some Credit” dataset, features XGBoost as the final model, and has been built with Streamlit, containerized with Docker, and deployed on Heroku using GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

<strong>ML:</strong> compared models; <em>XGBoost</em> selected.
<strong>Stack:</strong> Streamlit; Docker; GitHub Actions; Heroku.

<div class="project-card">

  <h3>3) Personal Inflation Impact (UK)</h3>
  <p>
While the first project focused on predicting property prices across London and the second explored the likelihood of loan default, this new work extends the economic journey to the next stage — managing the cost of living once financial commitments like a mortgage are in place.

After the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published its CPIH data on 17 September 2025, I became curious about how inflation affects people differently. As an Economist and Data Scientist, I wanted to understand the gap between the national inflation rate and what households actually experience in daily life.

Inflation is often presented as a single national figure, but each household faces a unique mix of rising costs — food, housing, transport, health, and more. This project bridges that gap by estimating a household’s personal inflation rate and comparing it with the national average, helping users see whether their living costs rise faster or slower than the economy overall.

The app uses official ONS CPIH data, allowing users to adjust their spending mix through sliders to reflect their household budget. It predicts the 3-month forward personal inflation rate and flags whether inflation risk is high or low relative to the national CPIH.

Technically, it was built in Python using pandas, scikit-learn, and LightGBM, integrated into a unified FastAPI + NiceGUI interface. Deployment was automated via GitHub Actions and hosted on Render, following the same CI/CD principles used in earlier projects. The dataset comes directly from the Office for National Statistics CPIH Divisional Index, ensuring accuracy and credibility.

<strong>Data:</strong> official <em>ONS CPIH</em>.
<strong>ML:</strong> time-aware regression with <em>LightGBM</em>; risk flag vs CPIH.
<strong>Stack:</strong> FastAPI + NiceGUI; Render; CI/CD.

  <h3>4) UK Grocery Price Recommender (Tesco vs Sainsbury’s)</h3>
  <p>
After using the previous Machine Learning App to assess how I am personally going to be affected by inflation, the next question is: how do I spend smarter on food now?

To spend smartly, I scraped real product listings from Tesco & Sainsbury’s (captured Nov 2025) and built an app that finds cheaper, similar alternatives across both retailers. Choose a category (pasta, cereals, cooking oil, rice, tinned tomatoes), optionally pick a brand and size, and the app shows where it’s cheaper and the % saving.

Under the hood (brief): TF-IDF on product names → KMeans clusters for comparable SKUs → cosine similarity for look-alikes → price normalisation (per kg/L), size filters, and “cheapest retailer” logic. Served via FastAPI with GitHub Actions CI/CD and deployed on Render.

<strong>ML:</strong> TF-IDF + cosine similarity, KMeans clusters, price rules.
<strong>Stack:</strong> FastAPI + Jinja; Render; CI/CD.
